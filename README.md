## Modules

A module in Node.js is a logical encapsulation of code in a single unit. It's always a good
programming practice to always segregate code in such a way that makes it more manageable
and maintainable for future purposes.

## Below are some of the popular modules

1. Express framework
2. Socket.io
3. Pug
4. MongoDB etc.

In order to use modules in a Node.js application, they first need to be installed using the Node
package manager(NPM).

`npm install express`
