## 1. Modules

A module in Node.js is a logical encapsulation of code in a single unit. It's always a good
programming practice to always segregate code in such a way that makes it more manageable
and maintainable for future purposes.

## 2. Below are some of the popular modules

1. Express framework
2. Socket.io
3. Pug
4. MongoDB etc.

In order to use modules in a Node.js application, they first need to be installed using the Node
package manager(NPM).

`npm install express`

## 3. What is the package.json file

The "package.json" file is used to hold the metadata about a particular project. This
information provides the Node package manager the necessary information to understand how
the project should be handled along with its dependencies.

The package.json files contains information such as the project description, the version of the
project in a particular distribution, license information, and configuration data.

The package.json file is normally located at the root directory of a Node.js project.
